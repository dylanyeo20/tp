CLIentTracker is a desktop CRM designed for property agents, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while
retaining a clean and simple visual interface. It enables efficient management of clients, property listings, notes, and
meetings through commands such as add, edit, find, and list, allowing users to update and retrieve information faster
than traditional GUI-based systems. For agents who are comfortable with typing, this significantly improves productivity
in day-to-day operations.

Unlike many web-based CRMs, CLIentTracker works fully offline, making it reliable in environments with poor or unstable
connectivity, such as property viewings or on-site visits. Core actions like searching, editing, or scheduling meetings
are performed instantly, without delays from loading or syncing. All data is automatically saved when the application
closes, ensuring records remain secure without manual intervention.

Built for agents who value speed, reliability, and control, CLIentTracker helps users focus on clients rather than tools
in fast-paced environments.

## :clipboard: Command Summary
{: #command-summary }

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  * e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

  * Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
    * e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Buyer` or as `n/John Doe`.

  * Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
    * e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Buyer`, `t/Landlord` etc.

  * Parameters can be in any order.<br>
    *  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

  * Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
    * e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

  * If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Locating persons: `find`

Search for persons using keywords across all fields or within specific fields.

#### **Format:**
- General search:
  `find KEYWORD...`

- Field-specific search:
  `find PREFIX/KEYWORD PREFIX/KEYWORD...`

**Prefixes:**
- `n/` — name
- `p/` — phone
- `a/` — address
- `e/` — email
- `d/` — details

> ⚠️ Prefix rules:
> - Prefixes are **case-sensitive** and must be in lowercase
    >   - ❌ `N/Alex` is invalid
>   - ✅ `n/Alex` is valid
> - Prefixes must be **preceded by a space**
    >   - ❌ `find n/Alexp/1234`
>   - ✅ `find n/Alex p/1234`

#### **General Search:**
- Searches across **all fields**
- Case-insensitive (`alex` = `Alex`)
- Supports partial matches (`lex` → `Alex`)
- Keywords are **comma-separated**
- If no commas are used, the entire input is treated as a **single keyword**
- Matches if **any keyword** is found (**OR** logic)

**Examples:**
- `find alex`
- `find alex, bob`
- `find alex bob` *(searches for "alex bob" as one phrase)*
- `find 9876`


#### **Field-Specific Search:**
- Searches only within specified field(s)
- Case-insensitive and supports partial matches
- Keywords must be **comma-separated**

**Examples:**
- `find n/Alex`
- `find p/9876`
- `find n/Alex, Bob p/9123`


#### **Rules:**
- Keywords within the same prefix use **OR**
  - `find n/Alex, Bob` → name contains *Alex* or *Bob*
- Different prefixes use **AND**
  - `find n/Alex p/9123` → name contains *Alex* AND phone contains *9123*


#### **Important Notes:**
- You **cannot mix general search and prefix search**
  - ❌ `find alex p/9876`
- Commas are required if you want to separate multiple keywords
  - ❌ `find n/Alex Bob` 
  - ✅ `find n/Alex, Bob`

### :floppy_disk: Data Storage & Saving

Client Tracker is designed to be **fast and worry-free** — your data is automatically saved after every command.

There is **no need to press a save button**. Everything is stored locally on your device, allowing you to:
- Work completely offline
  - Access your data instantly
  - Avoid losing changes due to unsaved progress

All data is stored in:

`[CLIentTracker file location]/data/addressbook.json`

CLIentTracker is intended for **medium to moderately large contact lists**. Performance may degrade for very large
datasets, especially above **50,000 to 100,000 contacts**, depending on your device's memory and CPU.

---

### :pencil2: Editing the data file

Client Tracker data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[CLIentTracker file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" cl ass="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Client Tracker will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause Client Tracker to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>


---

## :question: FAQ
{: #faq }

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data from your previous Client Tracker home folder.

---

## :warning: Known Issues
{: #known-issues }

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
